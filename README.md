# Predictng Rides on Montreal's Maxi Bikes
The goal of this analysis is to determine the factors that influence the amount of rides taken from a particularly station in montreals maxi bike program.  By determining these factors we can help the Maxi Bike parent company in two main ways: 
1. we can help optimize the distribution of bikes to hopefully reduce the costs associated with the relocation of bikes around the city.
2. We can discover optimal locations for stations that will help with the future expansion of the network of stations.
